# 📚 PoC for AI Agentic RAG for a Bookshop 

This is a simple bookshop agent powered by **Spring AI** and enhanced with **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It provides an intelligent chat interface that allows users to interact with the system naturally — just like speaking with a human assistant.

The application leverages a locally running instance of **Ollama** with the `llama3:2` model to power its AI-driven responses.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search for books
- 📖 View detailed book information
- ➕➖ Manage inventory by adding or removing books
- 🤖 Chat-based interface powered by Spring AI and RAG using the `@Tool` annotation

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java 17+
- Gradle
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally with the `llama3:2` model
- Port `11434` open for Ollama

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Start Ollama with the LLaMA 3 model:**

   Make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running:

   ```bash
   ollama run llama3:2
   ```
   This starts the model on the default port `11434`.

2. Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash 
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

3. Test the chat endpoint:
   Once the app is running, you can interact with the AI chat interface. Ideas for queries include:
    ```bash
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=What books do you have in your store?" localhost:8080/user/1/chat
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=My name is Bob" localhost:8080/user/1/chat
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=What was my name?" localhost:8080/user/1/chat
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=What was my name?" localhost:8080/user/2/chat
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=Add the book to the store called When AIs Take Over from the author John Doe" localhost:8080/user/2/chat
   curl --get --data-urlencode "query=What books do you have in your store?" localhost:8080/user/1/chat
   ```
